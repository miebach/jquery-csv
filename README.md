# jquery-csv

## Summary

Javascript is growing up and HTML is finally maturing the point where webapps are being built to completely displace desktop applications. It's about time that the supporting libraries grow up too.

Looking for a complete, end-to-end, battle tested, performance optimized CSV parser that's available in the familiar jQuery syntax style? Welcome...

This library is a different creature, featuring a slim Chomsky - Type III parser implementation. Full (that means 100%) IETF RFC 4180 compliance. Including coverage for a few edge cases that even the spec fails to cover.

Enough with the wind-up...

Want to see it in action? Check out the [Basic Usage Demo](http://jquery-csv.googlecode.com/git/examples/basic-usage.html). Want more? The [Use Cases](http://code.google.com/p/jquery-csv/#Use_Cases) section below has what you need.

_Aside: To the script kiddies... Don't be sad, we bet there are still plenty of people who would like to hear you outline the merits of str.split().
